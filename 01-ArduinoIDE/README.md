Nothing special here. Instead, follow the SparkFun tutorial [here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/rfm69hcw-hookup-guide?_ga=1.179097508.1448762088.1492478334). Once you have that, feel free to move on. It's handy to start here because if you experience any issues with future development work you can come back to the work done in that tutorial to test out the system.
