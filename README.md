# Starting Embedded Development Talk
This repo is for a talk that will be given at the Orlando IoT meetup in November. The goal is to cover the different ways you can develop an embedded app on the AVR platform. This talk assumes you have a basic understanding of electronics and software development. This was all done on a Windows 10 computer that has the Arduino IDE, Atmel Studio 7.0, and Visual Studio 2017 installed. The concepts should all still be relevant if your development is done in different environments. 

This talk assumes you are using the following hardware:
- [Arduino Pro 328](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10914?_ga=2.242661826.1796806344.1537385844-1351577317.1532644255)
- [SparkFun RFM69 Transceiver](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12775?_ga=2.242661826.1796806344.1537385844-1351577317.1532644255) 
- Some elctronics basics, LEDs, resistors, etc


## Abstract for this Talk:
Getting started in embedded software development is still a difficult journey. Starting out with an Arduino is great, but it's less than ideal for large applications. This talk will go over the options you have when starting an embedded application and help you get a grasp on the options that are out there.
